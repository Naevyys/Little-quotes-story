# About our story

[Dummy text to be replaced with nice introduction]

# Biases

[Feel free to modify the text here too]  
We are delighted to present the results of our analyses! However, it is essential to first learn about the biases of our data. We detail them [here](/biases)!

# Our analysis outcomes

[Again, write a nice text here]  
You can find our analysis and interpretations [here](/analysis)!

# References

[Sources of data (Quotebank, wikidata etc.)]  
[Eventual other references to support claims/interpretations/conclusions we make - we should probably add these on the [analysis](/analysis) page too]
